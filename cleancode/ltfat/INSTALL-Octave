-------- Compatibility ----------------------------------

The toolbox should work and compile on all versions of Octave later
than version 3.0, but it is generally recommended to upgrade to the
latest stable release of Octave. For demos etc. to work, you will need
to install some of the Octave-forge packages.

LTFAT >=1.4.2 is also itself an Octave-forge package and the easiest
way to install everything is by typing

pkg install -forge ltfat

on the octave prompt, which downloads ltfat directly from the 
Octave-forge and compiles all. This however was tested only on Linux.
Since you are reading this you have probably downloaded ltfat from
elsewhere and you want to compile sources by yourself. 

-------- What can be compiled -------------------------------

- Static backend libraries libltfat.a, libltfatf.a

- Fast Oct-interfaces linking to the backend libs.

Block processing framework (optional, experimental, only on Linux)

- Mex-interface playrec

- Java classes for blockproc GUI

-------- Compiling backend libs and the Octave interfaces  -------------

LTFAT comes with C++ Octave interfaces to replace (shadow) all computationally
intensitive functions in the toolbox.

To compile the Octave interfaces, type "ltfatmex" on the Octave
command prompt. This will compile the ltfat C library and all the
available oct-functions.

LTFAT backend lib and Oct-interfaces depends on the following
libraries: FFTW3, BLAS, LAPACK, which are usually distributed with
Octave itself, so there is no need for installing them separately.

--------- Compiling on MacOS ------------------------------------------

TBD

--------- Compiling on Microsoft Windows ------------------------------

Presently, Octave binary distribution for Windows comes in 32bit version only.
We recommend using the package with the MinGW installer. It comes with the 32bit
MinGW compiler system. It is important to add the following two entries to the PATH 
variable:

[OCTAVE]\bin\;[OCTAVE]\mingw\bin\; 

where [OCTAVE] stands for the Octave installation directory.

Then typing "ltfatmex" should compile the Oct-interfaces. 

--------- Compiling on Linux ----------------------------------------

To compile, you must have installed the Octave development package and
all its dependencies (the 'mkoctfile' script must be available).
This will also install all necessary libraries and header files needed
for compilation.

* On Fedora / Redhat this package is called "octave-devel"

* On Debian / Ubuntu this package is called "octave-headers"

Install the octave-forge packages to add extra toolboxes available for
Octave.
