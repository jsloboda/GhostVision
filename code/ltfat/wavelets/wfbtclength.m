function [Lc,L]=wfbtclength(Ls,wt,varargin);
%WFBTLENGTH  WFBT subband lengthf from a signal length
%   Usage: L=wfbtlength(Ls,wt);
%          L=wfbtlength(Ls,wt,...);
%
%   wfbtlength(Ls,wt) returns the length of a Wavelet system that is long
%   enough to expand a signal of length Ls. Please see the help on
%   WFBT for an explanation of the parameter wt.
%
%   If the returned length is longer than the signal length, the signal
%   will be zero-padded by WFBT to length L.
