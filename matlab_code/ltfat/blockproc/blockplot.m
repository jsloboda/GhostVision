function cola=blockplot(p,F,c,cola)
%BLOCKPLOT Plot block coefficients
%   Usage: blockplot(p,F,c);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         p     : JAVA object of the class net.sourceforge.ltfat.SpectFrame.
%         F     : Frame object.
%         c     : Block coefficients.
%         cola  : (Optional) overlap from previous block.
%
%   Output parameters:
%         cola  : Overlap to the next block.
%
%   BLOCKPLOT(p,F,c) appends the block coefficients c to the running 
%   coefficient plot in p. The coefficients must have been obtained by
%   c=blockana(F,...). The format of c is changed to a rectangular 
%   layout according to the type of F.
%
%   BLOCKPLOT(p,[],c) does the same, but expects c to be already
%   formatted matrix of real numbers. The matrix dimensions are not
%   restricted, but it will be shrinked or expanded to a vertical
%   strip in the sliding image.
%
%   cola=BLOCKPLOT(p,F,c,cola) does the same, but adds cola to the 
%   first respective coefficients in c and returns last coefficients from
%   c. This is only relevant for the sliced window blocking approach.
